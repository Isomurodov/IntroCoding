    "The book written by George Polya in 1995, and entitled *How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method*, discusses in depth the main steps followed to solve mathematical problems. However, these steps are quite general and can be used to *solve computational problems* too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main steps:\n",
    "1. Understand the problem\n",
    "2. Devise a plan\n",
    "3. Carry out the plan\n",
    "4. Look back\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategies to apply in steps 1 and 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do I know about the problem?\n",
    "- What is the information that I have to process in order the find the solution?\n",
    "- What sort of special cases exist?\n",
    "- What does the solution look like?\n",
    "- Can you think of two similar problems? (**never reinvent the wheel**)\n",
    "- How will I recognize that I have found the solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "An important strategy is **Divide and Conquer (D&C)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break up a large problem into smaller units and solve each smaller problem \n",
    "- Apply the **concept of abstraction**, since we start from a *large and abstract task*, and then apply D&C over and over again, until each *subtask is manageable*, and can be solved concretely (e.g., by coding it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Devise a plan == **Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In computing terms, to devise a plan means to find an **unambiguous sequence of instructions** to solve a task or a subtask, obtained by applying D&C.\n",
